# Key4hep Reco Validation

Collection of scripts for the Key4hep reconstruction validation plots. The
validation is primary focused on reconstruction, but can be used by other steps
of the event reconstruction chain as well.

The resulting validation plots can be found at
[key4hep-validation.web.cern.ch](https://key4hep-validation.web.cern.ch/).

Running of the validation scripts is done by a GitLab CI script found
[here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/key4hep/k4-validation).
